# PSMR Simulator

This is a simulator of a Parallel State Machine Replication. There are many algorithms being developed aiming to balance workload in PSMR, this simulator was developed in order to collect data on the execution of new algorithms without the need to implement them in a full working prototype.

Workload can be random, following different patterns, or imported. Given a workload and execution options, PSMR Simulator allows some insight on thread's usage, execution and idle time, and number of synchronizations.
